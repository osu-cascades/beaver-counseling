## Install

Before running this web app you will need to install rails 5.1.4 and ruby 2.4.2.
You will also need to install PostgreSQL.

###### To install Ruby you will first need Xcode Command Line Tools
```
$ xcode-select --install
```

###### Install Homebrew
Check if Homebrew is installed:
```
$ brew
-bash: brew: command not found
```

To avoid RVM installation issues, install Homebrew before RVM. If Homebrew is not installed, install it:
```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

###### Install RVM
The RVM website explains how to install RVM. Here’s the simplest way:
```
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```
For more install information checkout: https://rvm.io/rvm/install

###### Install Ruby
After installing RVM, install the newest version of Ruby.
You must specify a version number to install the newest stable Ruby version:
```
$ rvm install ruby-2.4.2
```

###### Install Rails
At the time we made the app the most recent version was rails 5.1.4
```
$ gem install rails
```

###### Install PostgreSQL
You will also need to download PostgreSQL. We used the Graphical Installer which can be found at:
https://postgresapp.com/

You can also download manually via:
https://www.postgresql.org/download/


## Getting Started

Once you have downloaded Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL you can now begin.

Go ahead and clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/osu-cascades/beaver-counseling
$ cd beaver-counseling
```

Next, run bundle install to download the necessary gems
```
$ bundle install
```

You will need to create to database
```
$ rake db:create
```

You will then need to migrate the database
```
$ rake db:migrate
```

Then create the initial admin run the db:seed command
```
$ rake db:seed
```

Finally start the server
```
$ rails server
```

Then open a web browser with the web address localhost:3000 to see the app running.

## Deployment

We are using Google Cloud Platforms' App Engine to host the application.
Hosted at: http://cascadesclinic-197917.appspot.com/

2. Run 
```
$ gcloud app deploy --version dev
```

4. Run any migrations with 
```
$ bundle exec rake appengine:exec -- bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

5. View website using 
```
$ glcoud app browse 
```

## Heroku Deployment

Make sure you have a "staging" and "production" remote for Heroku
```
git remote -v
```

What gets pushed to git can also get pushed to Heroku.
```
git push -f [staging/production] [master/development]
```

View Heroku env vars
```
heroku config --remote [production/staging]
```

Add or remove Heroku env vars
```
